### Manage Facilities and Services

Navigate to "<path to linksf instance>/admin.html" in your browser while linksf is running, and log in with the credentials that you used to create your admin user in Parse. If you already imported Facilities, you should see a list.

To add new Facilities, click the 'New Facility' link in the top bar to the right of the search bar. You'll see a form to fill out to create new facilities.

To edit existing facilities, just click a facility's name in the list view and the same form will appear. You can return to the list view at any time by clicking the link at top left.
