### History

https://vimeo.com/87203260

The Tenderloin Technology Lab serves many low-income residents that are looking for web access. One of the trends in recent years has been that a significant percentage of users (40% as of February 2014, up from 33% the previous year) have access to smartphones. Low-income households especially are increasingly reliant on smartphones - 45% of smartphone-owning <30k households use mobile web as their primary device for internet access vs 27% of >75k households. Web access and literacy is crucial for job or housing applications, as well as family and social networks.

Link-SF is a mobile web app designed to give this growing community of smartphone users instant access to relevant services on the go by surfacing crucial information like open hours, phone numbers, and Google Maps directions.

### Note
In January 2016, Facebook [announced](http://blog.parse.com/announcements/moving-on/) the impending shutdown of the Parse service. Since that time, our team has been working on creating a new solution for all instances of the Link-SF project that does not rely on Parse. Our secondary mission for Version 2 is to support data which is in the [OpenReferral format](https://openreferral.org/) and inspired by the [Ohana API](https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api). 

This current work can be found in the [open-referral](https://github.com/zendesk/linksf/tree/open-referral) branch of this project. We aim to have everything in place to give current users of Link-SF a smooth way to transition to the new platform without losing data before Parse shuts down. If you would like to use the original version before the release of the second one, you will need to set up your own [Parse server](https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server/wiki/Parse-Server-Guide) and please note that we are not presently developing the master branch of this project. Contact us at linksf@zendesk.com if you need assistance during this interim.
